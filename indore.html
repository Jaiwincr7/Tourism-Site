        <p style="font-size: 17px; padding-top: 30px;">A trading hub between the Deccan and Delhi in the 16th century, the city of Indore was discovered by Rao Nandlal Chaudhary. 
            Later, Rani Ahilya Bai Holkar, with her keen interest in education and planning, built the largest city in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
             Indore, being ranked as 'the cleanest city in India' for the fifth consecutive year has reserved its place in the first 20 cities to be developed as smart cities as well. </p>
       <p style="font-size: 17px;">
            The metropolitan yet traditional vibe of Indore attracts tourists for fabulous places to visit and fantastic food to taste
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Today, Indore has numerous places to visit from a spectacle of majestic palaces co-existing with commercial centers. 
        The birth-land of The Indore Gharana of Hindustani Classical Music has a rich history of the architectural marvel from the Maratha era that allures the visitors. 
        Indore is home to spectacular The Kanch Mandir, which is made entirely of glass and mirrors, luxurious Lal Bagh Palace and Royal Rajwada.
