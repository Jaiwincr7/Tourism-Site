        <p style="font-size: 17px; padding-top: 30px;">Situated at a mounting height, Pachmarhi, popularly known as 'Satpura ki Rani' (Queen of Satpura) sits beautifully amidst the Satpura range. 
            This attractive town was snuggled in the hills and forests until it was discovered by Captain James Forsyth in 1857. 
            It is one of the most popular destinations in Madhya Pradesh and is a treasure trove of rich history and nature's bounty. The 'Pandavas Caves' in the town is a popular attraction which has a fascinating tale. 
            The legend has it that these caves were built by the Pandavas who lived here along with their wife Draupadi during their exile. </p>
       <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Another point of interest is the stone formed JataShankar cave that resembles the hundred-headed divine snake Seshnag. 
        As per folklore, it is where Lord Shiva had supposed to have hidden from the Demon Bhasmasur. 
        The rocks of this sacred cave looks like the tangled hair of Lord Shiva, hence it is named Jata Shankar.
